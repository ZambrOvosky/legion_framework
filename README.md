# LEGION PMC - Mission Framework

This project is a collection of Arma 3 framework projects wich the intention of making it easier for the group **LEGION PMC** mission editors to work with. It's not intended to be large scale distributed, but any question, bug reports and such things are welcome. As was said, it have very specific propouse and is garanteed you that you can find a lot other frameworks that work better for you and your group.

## Based projects - References

As it's a collection it have *'parents'*, so here were we start with some sources that match with the code above.

### [GreuhZbug's Scripts (Inside the KP-Liberation)](https://github.com/KillahPotatoes/KP-Liberation)
Some scripts that was taken from the project just for it's functionality. The project isn't a framework, but I taken the code that I wanted and edited it.
Feel free to take a look of the [Wyqer](https://github.com/Wyqer) work on the Liberation project, it's really worthy it.
The project referenced is a fork of the *(I guess)* abandoned [project](https://github.com/GreuhZbug/greuh_liberation.Altis) of [GreuhZbug](https://github.com/GreuhZbug).

### [Olsen Framework](https://github.com/dklollol/Olsen-Framework-Arma-3)
That's was the point were I started thinking on creating a missions framework for my group. A friend showed me this and I liked it so much, but I got a feel that it'll not be worthy in my project, cause, aparentily, [dklollol](https://github.com/dklollol) (the project creator) abandoned his work. So I looked around it for something more recent.
So my friend showed me the next reference.

### [Olsen Framework (Global Conflicts fork)](https://github.com/Global-Conflicts-ArmA/Olsen-Framework-Arma-3)
You probably already know what's it by the title, the unofficial continuation of the Olsen Framework project. The [Global Conflicts](https://github.com/Global-Conflicts-ArmA) team developed and worked on it from it's core, introducing new functionalities, code review and support, everything I was looking for. So that's it, I use it as my framework core. Some changes, but it's the heart for everything.
